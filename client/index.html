                    <h2>Rules</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You must try to explain as many words as possible in limited time.</li>
                        <li>You cannot say the word or use any of the four banned words in your explanation.</li>
                        <li>
                            Rule 2 applies to compound words and derived words that use the same stem as in your word or one of the four banned words as well.<br/>
                            E.g. you can't say “fire”, “truck” or “fire brigade” if your word is “fire truck”.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As the explainer, you cannot speak another language if you don't know a word. Explain your way around it.<br/>
                            You are, however, allowed to use a dictionary if you think that is a worthwhile use of your very limited time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As the guesser, you must say the exact word—synonyms don't count.<br/>
                            However as the explainer you're allowed to say that the guesser is close and is looking for a synonym.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You're only allowed to guess and explain based on the semantics of the word.<br/>
                            I.e. you're not allowed to give meta information such as the amount of characters, amount of vowels etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>You cannot use proper nouns.</li>
                        <li>
                            You cannot describe something as being the opposite of something to avoid using a banned word.<br/>
                            E.g. if you can't use the word “dark”, you cannot describe it as being “the opposite of light”.
                        </li>
